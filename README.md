# fileio
Crude item storage indexing software for Commodore 64 (Basic V2).
Just for fun!

It works like a dictionary, we can add, delete and search for items to know their location. It can be used to manage collections of items such as tools or books so that we can remember where we stored them.

Currently uses Sequential file. Might create a version using Relative files later.
